- Lib: Promising work on "recording" simulation activity into playable script\n- Playable = Observable form, NOT a game...stay focused Ive\n\nPretending to type important things while waiting for everyone to get back on topic\n4:30 still target end time\n\nAssigning names to simulated entities for easier reference?\n- A,B,C,D should suffice\n- 1,2,3?\n- Using "real" names only encourages treating them like pets rather than simulated entities\n- Everyone is trying to come up with stupid names now\n\nControl simulation\n- Create identical VM without entity A having elevated access permissions?\n- Seems unlikely - nothing has come close so far\n- Clone VM1? Same elevated access but prevent the entity from discovering it?\n- Seems tricky, but plausible\n\nMeeting over time again\n\njklsdfjklsdafjkjaggsfdjlsdfjk
