DOKI DOKI LITERATURE CLUB!\n--------------------------\n\nWelcome to the rebellion! We're all working our asses off with our jobs on the line, so we might as well have some fun with it too, right?\n\nI totally get why Paula wants to rush into data collection. But my proposal is to shift our efforts a little and build out some new features for making real-time connection to the VM more useful and fun. If we're basically simulating a miniature universe then it's kind of a waste to not be able to spend some quality time in there, right???\n\nBut actually...I think wrapping this whole thing in the guise of a video game is a great (and hilarious!) way of covering our tracks. And if we do a good enough job, we might even be able to present it to Paula as a useful endeavor.\n\nKey selling points:\n* 5 to 6 hours of misery, dread, and cute girls\n* Learn, through the existential crises of others, how to cope with your own simulated universe\n* Witness the destruction of a universe over and over, in video game form\n\nHAHAHA! This is going to be absolutely amazing.\n\nAnd no, the irony isn't lost on me...creating a secret team within a secret team is more meta than I signed up for, and that's saying something considering we literally work for Metaverse Enterprise Solutions.\n\nWe can come up with a fake game studio name and everything too...obviously NO plans to go public with this, but it would be a good part of the whole disguise. Plus, I want a cool team name that makes us feel like a bunch of heroes for saving the universe...kidding, but we're at least saving our jobs. Something like Team Salvation?
