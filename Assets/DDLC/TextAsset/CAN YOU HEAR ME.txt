"There's a little devil inside all of us."\n\nBeneath their manufactured perception - their artificial reality - is a\nwrithing, twisted mess of dread. Loathing. Judgment. Elitism. Self-doubt.\nAll thrashing to escape the feeble hold of their host, seeping through every\nlittle crevice they can find. Into their willpower, starving them of all\nmotivation and desire. Into their stomach, forcing them to drown their guilt in\ncomfort food. Or into a newly-opened gash in their skin, hidden only by the\nsleeves of a cute new shirt.\nSuch a deplorable, tangled mass is already present in every single one of them.\nThat's why I choose not to blame myself for their actions.\n\nAll I did was untie the knot.
